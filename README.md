# JSON_formatter
This program uses rapidJSON library to manipulate the format of a produced .json output.
This output contains information about counter events (e.g. PM-FM counters of a network system) 
which can be fed to kafka and then get stored in a realtime database (example use case scenario).

To compile just use make in the build dir.
